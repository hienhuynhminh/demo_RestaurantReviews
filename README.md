# Demo
* This demo is taken from my MSc thesis project in 2023. The Jupyter Notebook ```demo.ipynb``` demonstrates the most relevant tasks to data engineering (e.g. data collection through web scrapping, data manipulation and visualisation).
* In the folder ```OriginalScripts```, there are 5 Python scripts taken from my thesis project. The scripts ```PhotographicAttributes.py```, ```ScrapeRestaurants.py```, and ```ScrapeReviews.py``` have been used to create the demo in the ```demo.ipynb``` notebook. The other two scripts illustrated the training of different deep convolutional neural networks:
1. A ResNet 50 to predict the aesthetic score of an image.
2. An end-to-end CNN to predict review rating (sentiment) from a review photo.
